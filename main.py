# Tuples Practice #1
# Use a tuple method to count the number of times the value 2 appears in the following tuple,  and display the result (integer) on the screen:
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)

# Tuples Practice #2
# Convert the following tuple to a list, and store it in a variable called my_list.

tuple2 = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2}
my_list = list(tuple2)
print(my_list)

# Tuples Practice #3
# Extract the elements of the following tuple into four variables: a, b, c, d

tuple3 = (1, 2, 3, 4)
a, b, c, d = tuple3
print(a, b, c, d)
